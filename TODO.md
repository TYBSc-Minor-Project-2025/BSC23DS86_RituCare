# TODO: Enable Deletion of Specific Cycle History

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Step 1: Locate the "Recent Cycles History" section in app.py (under "📝 Log Period" page).
- [x] Step 2: Add a new section "Delete Specific Cycle" below the history table.
- [x] Step 3: Implement a selectbox to choose the cycle by its start date from the recent cycles.
- [x] Step 4: Add a delete button that removes the selected cycle entry from logs and saves the updated CSV.
- [x] Step 5: Ensure the deletion only affects period logs (not water logs) and handle edge cases (e.g., no cycles to delete).
- [x] Step 6: Test the functionality by running the app and verifying deletion works.
